# StandaloneHost

## Description

StandaloneHost is a utility that can host one V2 Audio Unit soft synth.
This is useful for playing soft synths that do not provide a standalone
program, without starting up a DAW or other hosting app. It is essentially
the Mac equivalent of the popular SAVIHost program for Windows with
additional features.

## Downloads

Releases can be downloaded [here](https://www.larrymtaylor.com/software.php).

## Dependencies
StandaloneHost requires Apple's CoreAudioSDK version 1.1. It can be
downloaded [here](https://github.com/nerrons/CoreAudioSDK).

## Contributing

Contributions that enhance StandaloneHost or fix bugs are very much 
appreciated. However, please note that I can't promise that all 
contributions will be accepted.

### Use Github Issues and Pull Requests

If you're capable of implementing the feature or bug fix yourself,
please open a pull request rather than opening an issue.

If you're not able to make the change yourself, please open an issue
after checking to be sure there's not already an existing open issue.

Contributions must be submitted using Github. Contributions sent as
code dumps via email are difficult to merge in, don't promote discussion
and iteration, and don't leave a comment trail explaining the change.

### Code style

StandaloneHost doesn't have a style guide document, but its
style should be easy to infer by reading the existing code. Please try
to match this style closely. Two rules are mandatory: 1) no tabs;
and, 2) indents are four spaces.
